---------Smart Electrical Cup Heater and Cooler----------------
Project Overview

The Smart Electrical Cup Heater and Cooler is a compact and budget-friendly device designed to maintain your beverage at the perfect temperature. It can heat or cool liquids quickly, making it ideal for tea, coffee, or other drinks. This project demonstrates practical electronics, control systems, and temperature management in a simple, cost-effective hardware solution.

-------------Features-------------------------

Dual Functionality: Can both heat and cool liquids.

Temperature Control: Maintains the beverage at the desired temperature.

Portable and Compact: Small size suitable for home or office use.

Budget-Friendly: Entire project built with components under ₹3000.

User-Friendly: Easy to operate with simple ON/OFF controls.

-------------Components Used-------------------

Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino / ESP32)

Peltier Module (for heating and cooling)

Temperature Sensor (e.g., LM35 / DS18B20)

Relay Module / MOSFET (for power control)

Power Supply

Cup Holder / Insulating Material

Wires, PCB, and basic electronics components

--------------How It Works--------------------------

The temperature sensor continuously measures the liquid’s temperature.

The microcontroller decides whether to heat or cool based on the current temperature vs. the target.

The Peltier module is powered accordingly:

One side heats the cup while the other side absorbs heat.

The system automatically maintains the liquid at a comfortable drinking temperature.


-----------Assembly Instructions-------------------------

Connect the temperature sensor to the microcontroller.

Attach the Peltier module with proper heat sinks to manage temperature.

Connect the relay/MOSFET to control power to the Peltier module.

Place the cup on the holder and insulate properly for better efficiency.

Power the system and upload the microcontroller code.
